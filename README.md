## List of ML Programs:
1. ** One Shot Learning with House Prices (CS211, Computer Architecture) **
- Languages used: C
- Algorithms used: Gauss Jordan Elimination (Method of solving a linear system of equations done by taking the augmented matrix = 
matrix merged with an identity matrix, or one only composed of 1's and 0's,and turning it into reduced row echelon form through row 
operations = multiplying a row by a scalar, multiplying a row by a scalar and adding it into another row, switching two rows),
Pseudoinverse ((X<sup>T </sup> X)<sup> -1 </sup> X <sup> T </sup> Y)
- Future: Try with LU Decomposition
