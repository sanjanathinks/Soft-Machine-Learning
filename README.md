Gauss Jordan Elimination:
<br>
Method of solving a linear system of equations done by taking the **augmented matrix** (a matrix merged with the identity matrix
which only contains 1's and 0's), and turning it into **reduced row echelon form** through **row operations** (multiplying
a row by a scalar, multiplying a row by a scalar and adding it to another row, switching two rows).

- Future: Try with LU Decomposition
